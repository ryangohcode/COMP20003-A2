"Local Government Area data:
Local Government areas range in population size between 100 to 1 million people. LGAs often have varying age and other demographic profiles affecting their coverage rates. LGA population estimates are taken from the latest ABS LGA by age release. 
Note on areas with large remote and very remote populations:
The  process of geocoding addresses in very remote areas and remote areas can lead to artificially low vaccine dose count records in those areas (as addresses cannot be ‘pinpointed’ to a specific client location, and therefore LGA). For vaccine rates relevant to these areas, please consult the weekly SA4 data release from Operation COVIDShield.  SA4 data is generally of larger population regions, so undercounting of doses has less impact on overall coverage rates. 
Methodology underpinning LGA Remoteness classification: 
LGA ‘remoteness’ is calculated by a assigning a modal remoteness value for each LGA, based on where the majority of the population in each LGA live - using 2016 Census meshblock population counts. Remote and Very Remote classifications accord with the same values if using the Modified Monash Model of remoteness.",,,,,
